# Typewriter - Animated Sentence

In this activity, we are going to take a sentence and display it as an animation.

## Goal:

Our goal is to animate the sentence, revealing one character at a time. This will make it look as though it is being typed in by someone.

## How To:

  1. Declare a variable, called sentence, with an example sentence.

  2. Use a for..of loop to iterate through the characters of the example sentence.

  3. Inside the for..of loop, use setTimeout to cause a delay of 50 ms.

  4. Add a newline character to setTimeout.
